Phone Control
============

Trying out web sockets with node.js as well as the HTML5 device orientation feature to control a browser with a mobile phone.

##Requirements

- Node.js
- A phone that supports the HTML5 Device orientation feature

##Usage

- Run 'npm install' in your command line to install the dependencies.
- The server runs on port 3000 so you need your browser and your phone to be connected to the same wifi in order for the server to connect to both.
- In your desktop browser go to 'localhost:3000'.
- In your phone's browser you need to get the IP address for computer and then add ':3000' to that.
